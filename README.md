# Music Displayer

- Add the "BPC_MusicInfo" component in some actor (probably the one you are playing music)
- Modify the Map inside "BPC_MusicInfo" adding your Sound Cues and the information you want to show.
- When you play a music sound cue, call the event "DisplayAudioInformation" in "BPC_MusicInfo", with the playing sound cue.
